Crafting good prompts is key to getting useful responses from large language models. Keep these principles in mind:

1. **Be specific.** Clearly outline the desired output and provide context.
2. **Set the format.** If you want bullet points, code, or a short summary, say so in the prompt.
3. **Iterate.** Review results and adjust prompts based on how the model responds.

Applying these techniques will help you generate clearer, more accurate results when working with AI assistants.
